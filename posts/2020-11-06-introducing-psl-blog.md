description: A new way to follow models in the Policy Simulation Library catalog.
layout: post
title: Introducing the PSL Blog
toc: true

---

Our mission at the Policy Simulation Library is to improve public policy by opening up models and data preparation routines for policy analysis.
To support and showcase our diverse community of users and developers, we engage across several mediums: a monthly [newsletter](https://www.pslmodels.org/Newsletter/archive.html), a Q&A [forum](http://discourse.pslmodels.org/), (now-virtual) [meetups](https://www.meetup.com/dc-psl-meetup/), our Twitter [feed](https://twitter.com/pslmodels), our YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf7WWCuZHs_FFLjuBW4a4_Q), [documentation](https://www.pslmodels.org/Catalog/index.html) for models in our catalog, and of course, issues and pull requests on [GitHub](http://github.com/pslmodels).

Today, we're adding a new medium: the PSL Blog.
We'll use this space to share major updates on our catalog, provide tutorials, and summarize events or papers that involve our models.

If you'd like to share your work on our blog, or to suggest content, [drop me a line](mailto:mghenis@gmail.com).
To follow along, add the PSL blog's RSS feed or subscribe to our [newsletter](https://www.pslmodels.org/Newsletter/archive.html).

Happy reading,

Max Ghenis

Editor, PSL Blog
