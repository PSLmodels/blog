For the Demo Day on November 16, I showed how to calculate a taxpayer's liabilities under current law and under a policy reform with Tax-Cruncher.
The Tax-Cruncher web application takes two sets of inputs: a taxpayer's demographic and financial information and the provisions of a tax reform.

For the first Demo Day example ([3:50](https://youtu.be/d4T-DOxm2QQ?t=230)), we looked at how eliminating the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and applying payroll tax to earnings above $400,000 would affect a high earner.
In particular, our hypothetical filer had $500,000 in wages, $100,000 in capital gains, and $100,000 in itemizable expenses.
You can see the results at [Compute Studio simulation #634](https://compute.studio/PSLmodels/Tax-Cruncher/634/).

For the second example ([17:50](https://youtu.be/d4T-DOxm2QQ?t=1070)), we looked at how expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit would impact a family with $45,000 in wages and two young children.
