 For Monday's PSL Demo Day, I showed how to use the `scf` and `microdf` PSL Python packages from the [Google Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) web-based Jupyter notebook interface.

 The `scf` package extracts data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, the canonical source of US wealth microdata.
 `scf` has a single function: `load(years, columns)`, which then returns a `pandas` `DataFrame` with the specified column(s), each record's survey weight, and the year (when multiple years are requested).

 The `microdf` package analyzes survey microdata, such as that returned by the `scf.load` function.
 It offers a consistent paradigm for calculating statistics like means, medians, sums, and inequality statistics like the Gini index.
 Most functions are structured as follows: `f(df, col, w, groupby)` where `df` is a `pandas` `DataFrame` of survey microdata, `col` is a column(s) name to be summarized, `w` is the weight column, and `groupby` is the column(s) to group records in before summarizing.

 Using Google Colab, I showed how to use these packages to quickly calculate mean, median, and total wealth from the SCF data, without having to install any software or leave the browser.
 I also demonstrated how to use the `groupby` argument of `microdf` functions to show how different measures of wealth inequality have changed over time.
 Finally, I previewed some of what's to come with `scf` and `microdf`: imputations, extrapolations, inflation, visualization, and documentation, to name a few priorities.
