            "content": ". In the PSL Demo Day video linked above, I demonstrate how to use the Cost-of-Capital-Calculator (CCC) web application on Compute-Studio. CCC computes various measures of the impact of the tax system on business investment. These include the Hall-Jorgenson cost of capital, marginal effective tax rates, and effective average tax rates (following the methodology of Devereux and Griffith (1999)). . I begin by illustrating the various parameters available for the user to manipulate. These include parameters of the business and individual income tax systems, as well as parameters representing economic assumptions (e.g., inflation rates and nominal interest rates) and parameters dictating financial and accounting policy (e.g., the fraction of financing using debt). Note that all default values for tax policy parameters represent the “baseline policy”, which is defined as the current law policy in the year being analyzed (which itself is a parameter the user can change). Other parameters are estimated using historical data following the methodology of CBO (2014). . Next, I change a few parameters and run the model. In this example, I move the corporate income tax rate up to 28% and lower bonus depreciation for assets with depreciable lives of 20 years or less to 50%. . Finally, I discuss how to interpret output. The web app returns a table and three figures summarizing marginal effective total tax rates on new investments. This selection of output helps give one a sense of the the overall changes, as well as effects across asset types, industries, and type of financing. For the full model output, one can click on “Download Results”. Doing so will download four CSV files contain several measures of the impact of the tax system on investment for very fine asset and industry categories. Users can take these files and create tables and visualizations relevant to their own use case. . Please take the model for a spin and simulate your own reform. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, please let me know on the PSL Discourse (non-technical questions) or by opening an issue in the CCC GitHub repository (technical questions). .

            "title": "Demo Day 2: Tax-Cruncher",
            "content": ". For the Demo Day on November 16, I showed how to calculate a taxpayer’s liabilities under current law and under a policy reform with Tax-Cruncher. The Tax-Cruncher web application takes two sets of inputs: a taxpayer’s demographic and financial information and the provisions of a tax reform. . For the first Demo Day example (3:50), we looked at how eliminating the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and applying payroll tax to earnings above $400,000 would affect a high earner. In particular, our hypothetical filer had $500,000 in wages, $100,000 in capital gains, and $100,000 in itemizable expenses. You can see the results at Compute Studio simulation #634. . For the second example (17:50), we looked at how expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit would impact a family with $45,000 in wages and two young children. You can see the results at Compute Studio simulation #636. . Resources: . Tax-Cruncher | Tax-Cruncher-Biden | .",

I demonstrate how to build policy reform files using the Tax-Brain webapp on Compute Studio. (Useful links below.) This is an introductory lesson that ends with a cliffhanger. We don’t run the model. But we do generate an individual income and payroll tax reform file that is compatible with a range of policy simulation models and analytic tools, some designed for policy decision makers, others for taxpayers and benefits recipients interested in assessing their own circumstances. . Beyond individual and payroll tax analysis, the reform file can be used with models that assess pass-through and corporate taxation of businesses, as well as a variety of income benefit programs. A wide range of use cases will occupy future events. . Resources: . Demo C/S simulation | IRS Form 1040 | PSL Catalog | PSL Events | .",

To support and showcase our diverse community of users and developers, we engage across several mediums: a monthly newsletter, a Q&amp;A forum, (now-virtual) meetups, our Twitter feed, our YouTube channel, documentation for models in our catalog, and of course, issues and pull requests on GitHub. . Today, we’re adding a new medium: the PSL Blog. We’ll use this space to share major updates on our catalog, provide tutorials, and summarize events or papers that involve our models. .
